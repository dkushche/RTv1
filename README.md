# RTv1

Hello. As you know or not I was a student of UNIT Factory(Ukrainian school42) and I'm very proud of it.
Here is one of my first serious projects - basic ray tracer. I didn't change any directory structure or source code to save historical reference even if it looks messy and a bit stupid. It was a good time when I was at the begging of my career. I think it's still possible to build it under MacOS.
